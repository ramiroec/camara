Accessing User Camera with JavaScript and HTML5
This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript and HTML5 to access the camera of the user. The project uses the getUserMedia API, which is available in most modern browsers.

How to Run the Project
To run the project, you can simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Once the page has loaded, you should see a message asking for permission to access the camera. Click "Allow" to grant permission.

After you grant permission, you should see a live video stream from your camera. You can then use the buttons to take a photo or record a video.

How to Modify the Project
If you want to modify the project, you can edit the index.html and script.js files. Here are some things you might want to change:

index.html: This file contains the HTML code for the page. You can change the layout, add more buttons or controls, or modify the text.

script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that interacts with the getUserMedia API. You can modify this code to add more functionality, change the way the camera is displayed, or customize the way photos and videos are saved.

Browser Compatibility
The getUserMedia API is supported in most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. However, some older browsers may not support this API. If you encounter any issues, try updating your browser or using a different one.
